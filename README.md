# Application for the Applied AI curriculum lead
I am excited to apply for the position mentioned above, and I come with a unique blend of experience in AI-driven development and software engineering. I developed my SE portfolio project "Malawi Data Portal API" using Python and the Flask framework, harnessing the power of ChatGPT for data insights, project layout and API structure. I've also utilized AI tools like Midjourney AI and Leonardo AI to generate stunning visuals, while Writesonic AI has assisted me in crafting compelling content. My coding efficiency is further enhanced by using the Tabnine plugin, and I'm adept at leveraging Bing AI for searches and image generation. My familiarity with Google's Bard AI and my experience using ChatGPT for tasks like Microsoft Excel formula assistance underscore my passion for AI. Currently, I employ ChatGPT in my role as a software engineer at IDIAS CORPORATION to streamline debugging processes, reaffirming my commitment to driving AI innovation in my work.

I personally would like to go further with AI in my career as a software engineer.
This Job would help me share the passion to fellow next generation African Leaders.
